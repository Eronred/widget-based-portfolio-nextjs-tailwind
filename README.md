# My Portfolio

This is a portfolio project built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/). The portfolio is widget-based, allowing for easy customization and flexibility.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```

To run the development server:

You can start editing the page by modifying the widgets in the `components` directory. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
